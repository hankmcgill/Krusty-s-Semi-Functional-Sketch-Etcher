## Introduction
I made this etch-a-sketch style drawing app as part of The Odin Project's Foundations course.  We were asked to create a calculator from scratch using our own components and sense of design, so I decided to make a shameless knock-off of Krusty The Clown's aesthetic - it's what he would want.

## Features
I wrote this app using vanilla JavaScript.
